\title{Calculate Feiler Confidence Intervals}
\usage{
fieller_ci(b1, b2, V11, V22, V12, df, alpha = 0.05, tol = 1e-12, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{b1}{Estimate of the numerator.}

\item{b2}{Estimate of the denominator.}

\item{V11}{Variance of the numerator estimate.}

\item{V22}{Variance of the denominator estimate.}

\item{V12}{Covariance between the numerator and denominator estimates.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom for the t-distribution, potentially adjusted for persistence.}

\item{alpha}{Desired type I error rate (default is 0.05 for a 95\% CI).}

\item{tol}{Numerical tolerance for determining special cases (default is 1e-12).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, currently not implemented.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimate}: The point estimate of the ratio (b1/b2).
\item \code{ci}: The confidence interval(s) for the ratio. This can be a vector of length 2 for a bounded interval, or a list of two vectors for a complement interval.
\item \code{type}: A character string indicating the type of confidence interval: "bounded", "complement", "half-line", "all-real", or "empty".

Calculate Feiler Confidence Intervals

\details{
The degrees of freedom calculation could account for persistence in the data.  For an AR(1) process where $rho$ is the coefficient on y at time (t-1), the Inflation Factor is (1+rho)/(1-rho).  The adjusted degrees of freedom would be residual_df/Inflation Factor.
care should be taken to ensure that the adjusted degrees of freedom is not too small.  For example, setting a floor of 3 or more would work.
